# ChristmasSentiment

A very simple application built using the Go programming language.

The application scans twitter using the Twitter API every 10 seconds. Each tweet the application finds, it runs a sentiment analysis on the tweet. Any negative tweet it finds, it will print that to the console for a bit of humour.

Bit of a learning experiment really, but great fun!
